### Hi there my name is Alejandro Armas ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

## Background

Iâ€™m a first generation college student at the University of California, Davis and Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to have participated in a [couple research experiences](https://alejandroarmas.github.io/assets/AlejandroArmasResume.pdf) and I occasionally [blog](https://alejandroarmas.github.io) when time permits.

## Interests 

A dream job would be working on **building infrastructure** and platforms that make it easier to build, deploy, and monitor machine learning models. Likewise, I'm interested in building compiler stacks which target AI accelerators. 

I would like to grow into this career, as I can see myself applying my strong background in software development, technical design and architecture, scalability of software, best practices, and interest in ML towards a role which supports data scientists and the ML ecosystem as a whole.
