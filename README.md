### Hi there my name is Alejandro Armas ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

Iâ€™m a first generation college student at the University of California, Davis and Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to have participated in a [couple research experiences](https://alejandroarmas.github.io/assets/AlejandroArmasResume.pdf) and occasionally [blog](https://alejandroarmas.github.io) from time to time.  I would like to work on **building infrastructure** and platforms that make it easier to build, deploy, and monitor machine learning models. I'm interested in growing into that career, as I can see myself applying my strong background in software development, best practices, and interest in ML towards a role which supports data scientists.
